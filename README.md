## My process

I went with the vanilla way. Even though it took longer but it was worth it. I got to play around with different way doing things.

I followed these steps but still overlapped as time went by.

- Fleshed out the html
- Wrote the styles
- Added interactivity

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Lightbox - a library for image showcase built with jQuery.
